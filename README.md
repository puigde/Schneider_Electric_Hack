## Context 
The EU contributes 18% of total global warming gas emissions; However, it is increasingly determined to take the lead in the fight against climate change. That is why it has set itself the goal of reaching zero carbon emissions by 2050. To this end, it has put in place a wealth of resources to help achieve this goal over the next few years, and it will need our help to do so. In this context, Scheider Electric has brought us the following challenge.

## The challenge
Our goal is to predict the type of pollutant in a factory given a dataset containting information about it.

## What have we worked on
We have gone trough an full data analysis process starting at data gathering (from all sources including csv, json and pdf), followed by exploration and a meditated preprocessing which has allowed us to train diverse machine learning models. After testing around with the models hyperparameters we've selected a final model from which we obtain predictions on the pollution type for the unlabeled test data which was provided to us. 


## How we built it
We've built it fully on python using typical tools in ML tasks.

## Challenges, accomplishments and learning
We are second and third year students at the Data Science and Engineering Degree at UPC BarcelonaTech which belongs to the FIB, ETSETB and FME. ALthough this wasn't neither our first hackathon nor our first time working with Machine Learning tools having to face a real problem in this environtment has been a great learning experience. We've faced many obstacles which we have tried to sort out by discussing possible solutions and choosing the best one and we feel that this situations have put us in a great position for learning and growing as Data Scientists.

## Repo contents
This repo contains a python notebook with the full detailed process we've gone through plus the predictions for the test data.

## Thanks
Developed with :) at the Schneider Electric hackathon organized by NUWE. Thank you yo all the people who made it possible and has offered us guidance during the process.
